Description: An extension of the ts class with enhanced possibilities for
             period selection. regts particularly aims at yearly, quarterly and
             monthly timeseries. It also supports labels that can be used to
             describe the timeseries in multivariate timeseries objects.
             The package includes functions for reading and writing
             timeseries from Excel and csv files, conversion of timeseries to
             growth series and the inverse transformation, special aggregation
             methods for growth series, and several other functions.
