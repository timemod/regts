\title{Update a timeseries with another timeseries object}
\usage{
update_ts(x1, x2, method = c("upd", "updna", "updval", "replace"),
  join_second = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x1}{the first timeseries (a \code{\link{regts}} or
\code{\link[stats]{ts}} object).}

\item{x2}{the second timeseries (a \code{regts} or \code{ts} object).}

\item{method}{four different ways to update the timeseries.
By default the timeseries are updated. This behaviour can be changed by
using one of the other methods. See details.}

\item{join_second}{A logical (default \code{TRUE}) indicating whether columns
present in the second timeseries but missing in the first timeseries should
be added to the result.}
}
\value{
an updated \code{\link{regts}} object.
}
\description{
This function can be used to update, replace or extend a \code{(reg)ts}
object with another \code{(reg)ts} object.
The result is an updated \code{\link{regts}} object.
}
\details{
The two timeseries must have the same frequency, but may have a different
period range.
The common columns in the timeseries can be updated in four different ways:

\code{upd} the first timeseries are updated with the second timeseries for
the total period range of the second timeseries. Outside this period the
values in the first timeseries do not change.

\code{updna} if method \code{updna} is selected instead of \code{upd},
only NA values in the first timeseries will be updated

\code{updval} if method \code{updval} is selected instead of \code{upd},
the values in the first timeseries are only replaced with valid (i.e. non-NA)
values from the second timeseries.

\code{replace} like method \code{upd}, the values in the first
timeseries are replaced by the values in the second timeseries for the total
period range of these second timeseries.
Outside this period the values in the first timeseries will become
\code{NA}.

By default, columns only present in one of the two timeseries objects
are added to the result.
The result columns are the columns of the first series, supplemented
with the columns of the second series.
If parameter \code{join_second} is \code{FALSE} then the remaining columns
of the second timeseries are \emph{not} added to the result. Thus the result
series has the same columns as the first series.

The period range of the result is the union of the period ranges of the
first and second timeseries, except for the \code{updval} method.
For this method the result period range is the union of the period ranges
of the first timeseries and the timeseries obtained by applying function
\code{na_trim} to the second timeseries.
